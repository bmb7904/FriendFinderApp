FriendFinder -- Implementing a sorted linked list into a mock friend-finding app


 ************************* FRIEND FINDER APP *****************************
 *
 * This program will take in data for a person; this includes their name, interests, and the
 * importance of those interests as a numerical value. The data is read in as a .txt file.
 *
 * It will create records for each person and store the information
 *
 * The program will then sort & compare these records of people and output which of the
 * people have the most in common by comparing their interests
 *
 * Each person must have exactly 5 interests. This is hard coded.
